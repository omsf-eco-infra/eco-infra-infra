The subdirectories in this directory are the "apps" that the Eco-Infra team has
installed into their AWS account.

In general, we recommend that your repository containing such app installations
should be private. We're making ours public for educational purposes, and we
take special care to keep sensitive information out of this repository. The
danger is that someone could accidentally commit sensitive information to the
repository, and so it is best to keep it private.
